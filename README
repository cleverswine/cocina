== Plan  
      
  1.4.0 (Better category/tag selection II)
    -> update version in footer
    -> recipe index - dialog with catgeory drop-down + tag checkboxes (make partial from recipe form)
    
  2.0.0 (True multi user)
    -> refactoring - ajaxify (http://www.alfajango.com/blog/rails-3-remote-links-and-forms/)
    -> update version in footer
    -> Multi-user - model ownership, queries by user
    -> Multi-user - use IsAdmin authorization for controller actions
    -> Register for account workflow... need to confirm via email, or via admin approval
    -> on create user, must also create preferences or errors will occur
    -> Add email address to user model
    -> ? drop is_admin in favor of roles (admin, creator, browser, etc)
    -> ? Hide/restrict all editing actions from non-admin, creator role  
    -> send email to admins when new user is created (and maybe other events)

  2.x.0 (Landing page)
    -> create a landing page...
    
  2.x.0 (Export)
    -> export recipes from UI to ? format (multiple formats: rtf, html, txt, delim, yaml)
  
  3.x.0 (Sharing)
    -> Share recipe
      -> via email
      -> Facebook
      -> Twitter
  
  3.x.0 (Cross User Sharing)
    -> share recipes with other users
    
  Future
    -> thumb gallery - when click on thumb, spinny dial while big image loads    
    -> more responsive enhancements? see: (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#responsive)
    -> easy way to add photo from phone
    -> non-logged in view/browse
    -> Ajaxify some parts?
    -> scarfer - Select image from list (a la amazon wishlist)
    -> js -> coffee?
    -> better sass
    -> Feedback/tasks in admin to track... this
    -> Ajax search - live refresh of search results as you type (filter only)
    -> Ajax Category/Tag selection - live refresh of results when cat/tag selected in nav
    -> scarfer admin - save test url with each scarfer?
    -> Drag/drop recipe into Category/Tag in nav
    -> Consider splash/home screen instead of All Recipes as default.
    -> style the file inputs (photos, scarfers) 
    -> ?box layout on index, like this http://www.yummly.com/recipes/eggplant-parmesan
    -> Allow adding custom links in the "Tools" menu
